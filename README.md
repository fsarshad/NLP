# Introduction

As a team of three, at Columbia University, our project will be a step-by-step guide on how to train and test different types of NLP models. Such models include (Convo1D, Glove, Bert, and GP2). 

For the final submission of the project, we have included the three requirements: 
- GitHub README (the current file you are reading)
- [Final Report]()
- [Frontend Report]() + [modularized .py files]()
